# Markdown to HTML Converter - FreeCodeCamp Project

This is my first FreeCodeCamp certification project. It converts basic Markdown elements to HTML in real-time.

## Code Note
I'm new to programming and this is my first significant project. The code might:
- Have specific solutions for FreeCodeCamp test cases
- Be longer than necessary
- Not follow 100% best practices

As I progress through the course, I'll improve my coding style.

## Features
- Converts headings (#, ##, ###)
- Converts bold (**text**)
- Converts italic (*text*)
- Converts images and links
- Converts blockquotes (> text)
- Real-time preview

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in your browser
3. Write Markdown on the left
4. See the result on the right
